## Element Table

Elements are containers for content.

| **Element** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<style>`   | Contains style information for a document or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing this element.                                                                                                                         |
| `<title>`   | Defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.                                                                                                                                    |
| `<link>`    | Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things. |
| `<meta>`    | Represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like `<base>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, `<style>` and `<title>`.                                                                                                                                   |
| `<strong>`  | The `<strong>` element makes the text bold. It also semantically marks the text as important.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `<em>`      | The `<em>`element (em-emphasis)makes text italic. Also, semantically places emphasis on the text.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `<i>`       | Italic Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `<b>`       | Bold Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `<mark>`    | The HTML `<mark>` element defines text that should be marked or highlighted                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `<small>`   | Smaller Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

-----------------------------------------------

**Void Elements** - Some elements do not have a closing tag. These elements have only opening tag.**Eg :** `<br>`, `<img>` etc. Some elements just have a forward slash at the end like : `<br />` or `<img />`. The latest version of HTML specification specifically discourages their use and considers them invalid.

**DOCTYPE** - Every HTML page starts with a doc type declaration. DOCTYPE's purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. The latest version is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply `<!DOCTYPE html>`  

The doctypes for older versions of HTML were a bit more complicated. For example, this is the doctype declaration for HTML4:
`<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">`

**HTML Element** - We need to provide an `<html>` element. This is the root of the document, meaning every other document descends from it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
</html>
```

**Head Element** - The `<head>` element is where we put important meta-info about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser. Inside the `<head>`, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.

**Meta Element** - We should have the `<meta>` tag with the charset encoding of the webpage in the `<head>` element : `<meta charset='utf-8`

**Title** - The `<title>` element is used to give webpages a human-readable title which is displayed in our webpage's browser tab.

**Body Element** - The final element to complete the HTML boilerplate is the `<body>` element.This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links and so on.

**Viewing the HTML files in the browser - New Way** 

1. Ubuntu - Open terminal in the html file location, type `google-chrome index.html`
2. MacOS - In the directory, type `open./index.html`

**Commenting in HTML**

```html
<!-- I am a HTML comment -->
```

---------------------------------------------------------

## Lists

### `<start>` Attribute

The `<start>` attribute defines the number from which an ordered list should start. By default, ordered lists start at 1. 

```html
<ol start="30">
  <li>Head north on N Halsted St</li>
  <li>Turn right on W Diversey Pkwy</li>
  <li>Turn left on N Orchard St</li>
</ol>
```

### `<reversed>` Attribute

The `<reversed>` attribute is a Boolean attribute when used on the <ol> element, allows a list to appear in reverse order. An ordered list of five items numbered 1 to 5 may be reversed and ordered from 5 to 1.

```html
<ol reversed>
  <li>Head north on N Halsted St</li>
  <li>Turn right on W Diversey Pkwy</li>
  <li>Turn left on N Orchard St</li>
</ol>
```

### `<value>` Attribute

Used on an individual `<li>` list element within an ordered list to change its value eithin the list. The number of any list item appearing below a list item with a `<value>` attribute will be recalculated accordingly.

```html
<ol>
  <li>Head north on N Halsted St</li>
  <li value="9">Turn right on W Diversey Pkwy</li>
  <li>Turn left on N Orchard St</li>
</ol>
<!-- The list number changes to 9 and starts incrementing from there --> >
```

## Links and Images

### Opening Links in a New Tab

```html
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me</a>
```

- *target* attribute specifies where the link source will be opened.
- By default it will take on the *_self* value which opens the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab or window set it to *_blank*  
- *rel* attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.
- *noopener* value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.
- *noreferrer* value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link to it. It also includes the *noopener* behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.

>  The prevention of access that is caused by *noopener* prevents **phishing** attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to as **tabnabbing**. Adding the *noreferrer* value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it.

### Absolute and Relative Links

- When including relative links, prepone the link with `./` to avoid unexpected issues if both the pages/content are in the same directory

### Images

- Image width and height can be adjusted within the `img` tag itself

```html
<img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" height="310" width="310">
```

- Image Formats that can be used in HTML : 
  
  - JPG | GIF | PNG | SVG

3. Capitalize the subject line

4. Do not end the subject line with a period

5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line

6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
